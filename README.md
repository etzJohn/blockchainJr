# blockchainJr

This project was made to put my learnings in practice as to what a blockchain is and its basic mechanisms

### What is a blockchain?

A blockchain is simply a distributed ledger. 

Each time a transaction is performed, its data is added to a block. This block's
integrity is ensured using a cryptographic hash, in our case, SHA256

## WIP! will add more here to educate others and myself :)
